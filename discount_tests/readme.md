# Running Tests

From the main menu select `Test > Test Explorer`

You can now run all tests, or individual tests (right click on the test name to run in debug)

When running in debug mode, add breakpoints to pause execution. `F11` can be used to step through the code, and `F5` to continue to the next breakpoint.
